CLI tool for automated DevOps template generation and deployment

## Project status

This project was started as an experimental tool for generating infrastructure definitions based on high-level textual prompts.

Development of AI-powered features is currently on hold due to external API constraints and associated costs.

Future updates may be considered if more feasible solutions become available.
